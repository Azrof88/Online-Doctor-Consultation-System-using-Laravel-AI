That’s a solid base for a full-featured Online Doctor Consultation System! Since you’re using Laravel with Blade and planning to include ML for disease prediction, here are some additional features and ideas you could consider integrating:

### 🔐 Security & Authentication
- **Two-Factor Authentication** for admin and doctors.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** (admin, doctor, patient).
- **Encrypted patient medical records** storage (for privacy compliance like HIPAA/GDPR).

### 📊 AI & ML Features
- **Smart Triage System** – prioritize appointments based on symptom severity.
- **Chatbot Assistant** – a GPT-like symptom query helper before doctor consultation.
- **Prescription Recommendation System** – suggest common treatments for basic conditions.
- **Visual Diagnostics Upload** – allow image uploads (like skin rash) for AI-based preliminary detection.

### 📅 Patient & Appointment Management
- **Live queue management** for doctors (waiting list style).
- **Calendar sync** (Google Calendar/Outlook) for appointments.
- **Auto-reminders via SMS/Email** before appointments.

### 🧑‍⚕️ Doctor Features
- **E-Prescription generator** with downloadable PDF.
- **Consultation History** – see past patient interaction and notes.
- **Online video/audio consultation** (integration with WebRTC, Jitsi, or Zoom API).

### 🧑‍💻 Patient Features
- **Medical history & report upload** section.
- **Symptoms tracker diary** (for chronic patients).
- **Health tips or blog section** based on recent consultations.

### 📋 Admin Panel Add-ons
- **Analytics Dashboard** – number of users, appointments, common diseases.
- **Feedback and Rating System** – for doctors after each consultation.
- **Doctor onboarding** – application form with verification.

### 💬 Communication Features
- **Live chat or messaging system** between patients and doctors.
- **Notifications system** (in-app, email, and optional SMS).
- **Multilingual support** for wider audience reach.

### 🧪 Optional Bonus Features
- **Pharmacy integration** – link prescriptions with local pharmacies for delivery.
- **Lab test booking system** with report upload by lab admins.
- **Health insurance module** – allow users to manage policy and claims.
