**Sequencing project development**

The user wants guidance on which module to develop first: patient, doctor, or admin. I think a good approach is to start with the core user system and roles, focusing on authentication. Then, building admin functionality would lay the foundation, allowing for doctor and patient management. After that, I could move on to doctor-specific features, like profiles and scheduling, followed by the patient frontend for appointment booking and symptom checks. Alternatively, starting with patient registration might also work.

A sensible “building block” approach is to layer in features from the ground up, so that each piece you add can immediately be tested and used by the next. Here’s a recommended sequence:

---

## 1. Core foundation

1. **Migrations & Models**

   * Users, Roles, Doctors, Patients tables (and pivot tables)
   * Seed your `roles` table (and one initial “admin” user via a seeder)
2. **Authentication & Registration**

   * Web auth: login, logout, register (doctors + patients)
   * Admin user hard‐seeded (or created manually)

*Why first?*  Everything else—dashboards, appointments, payments—rests on having users in the system.

---

## 2. Admin module

1. **Admin Dashboard UI & Controllers**

   * CRUD for Doctors
   * CRUD for Patients
   * View all Appointments / Payments / Symptom Checks
2. **Policies & Middleware**

   * Only `user_type = admin` can reach these routes

*Why second?*  You need a way to populate and manage the doctor and patient records for real‐world testing.

---

## 3. Doctor module

1. **Doctor Dashboard**

   * View incoming appointments
   * Confirm/Cancel, start Zoom links
   * Edit availability schedule & bio
2. **Doctor APIs or AJAX**

   * Load/refresh availability and appointments

*Why now?*  You can test the full booking flow once doctors exist in the system.

---

## 4. Patient module

1. **Patient Dashboard**

   * Book new appointments (choose doctor, date/time, mode)
   * View/Pay for appointments, join Zoom, check status
   * Submit Symptom Checks and view history
2. **Payment integration**

   * Link your payment gateway (mock or real)

*Why last?*  Patient flows complete the end-to-end use case (from registration through booking and follow-up).

---

### Continuous steps to sprinkle in as you go

* **Validation & Policies** at each form
* **AJAX/REST endpoints** for dynamic UIs
* **Email notifications** (booking confirmations, reminders)
* **Two-factor or token-auth** for more security
* **API routes** (in `routes/api.php`) once your web flows are solid

---

By the end you’ll have:

1. **Core auth** →
2. **Admin tooling** (to manage your user base) →
3. **Doctor features** (to receive and manage bookings) →
4. **Patient features** (to request care and track their data)

Each layer builds on the last, giving you working pieces to click through and verify as you go.
